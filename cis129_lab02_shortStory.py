print('There was once a wizard who had spend a lifetime studying the magic of water, he knew everything there was to manipulating water.')
print('He then met a young wizard who began studying the magic of water, the old wizard smiled with pride as he saw the young wizard began to understand the magic well.')
print('He was then shocked as the young wizard starting doing things with the magic that he had never seen.')
